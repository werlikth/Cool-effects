Hello, muckemannen here

To use this effect, first select an image you want.

The format of the file has to be JPEG.

Secondly we will need to convert the image to base64,
sites like https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image
make this easy to do.

Third, open the "script.js" file and remove what is currently
in imgSrc with 'data:image/jpeg;base64, paste_your_base64_here';

Lastly just simply click the "index.html" file and
open with chrome (not sure if firefox works).

Then press F11 to fullscreen and hit record on OBS.

Happy glitch imaging.
