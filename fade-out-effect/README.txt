Hello Muckemannen here,

To use the blur effect choose a image to blur
and another for a background image.

Open "index.html" with Notepad or similar and
edit the <img src="name_of_your_blur_image">
for the image to blur

Then open the "blur.css" with Notepad and change
the background-image: urL("name_of_your_background_image");

Also in "blur.css" you can control the duration by changing:
animation: blur 10s ease 0s infinite;
-webkit-animation: blur 10s ease 0s infinite;
-moz-animation: blur 10s ease 0s infinite;
To the number of seconds you desire.

Then simply click the "index.html" and press F11
for fullscreen and start recording with OBS :)
